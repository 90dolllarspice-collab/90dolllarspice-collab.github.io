      </h1>

      <p class="sub">
        We are the <strong>only</strong> company in the world that truly has such low ethical and moral principles that we will not only take your harness and your money, but also lie to you, threaten you, and render whatever vehicle you care about enough to want to fix for two years.        We do not care that our business is based on trapping people.
        We have had <strong>zero</strong> warranty claims, because we have never had anything to warranty. 
        
        They are not restoring wiring harnesses the way OEMs do. They are restoring customer confidence over time, using oxidation as the story that makes waiting feel necessary.”

          <h2>⚠️ CONSUMER WARNING: READ BEFORE SENDING YOUR HARNESS</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>This business operates a possession-driven specialty service that fundamentally changes the power balance the moment your wiring harness leaves your hands.

You are required to ship irreplaceable property before pricing is fixed, before timelines are defined, and before the full consequences of their process are clear. What is described as an “inspection” quickly becomes material alteration, after which your harness can no longer be returned in its original condition.

From that point forward, you cannot easily leave.

The company’s workflow is built around long, opaque internal procedures that cannot be independently verified. Progress is described in abstract phases and cycles rather than measurable outputs. Time is treated as proof of quality. Delay is reframed as safety. Questioning the process is discouraged through dense technical language and appeals to proprietary expertise.

If you later demand your property back, communication often escalates immediately. Safety risks are invoked. Legal language appears. The tone shifts from service to control. This escalation tends to occur only when possession is challenged, not during routine updates. The message is clear: continuing is safer than exiting.

Pricing is finalized only after your harness is fully under their control. Deposits are required, funds are banked, and work is queued. This creates a backlog that financially benefits the business while exposing customers to open-ended timelines with no external accountability.

The process minimizes new parts and relies heavily on labor narratives, reclaimed components, and internal judgment calls that cannot be audited by the customer. Industry standards are dismissed. Comparison is discouraged. The customer is asked to trust—not verify.

The business explicitly rejects warranties, reframing the absence of post-service protection as confidence rather than risk transfer. Any future failure is positioned as unavoidable or external, not the result of workmanship.

This is not a conventional repair service. It is a high-friction custodial model that monetizes time, control, and uncertainty.

Once disassembly begins, your leverage collapses.
Once irreversible steps are taken, your options narrow.
Once possession is disputed, pressure replaces service.

This model is not automatically illegal—but it is high risk by design.

If you proceed, understand this clearly:
You are not buying a defined repair with a defined outcome.
You are surrendering possession to a process that you cannot observe, cannot benchmark, and may not be able to exit without confrontation.

Proceed only if you are fully comfortable losing control of your property for an extended, undefined period—and relying entirely on the company’s internal representations to get it back.</li>

        <h2>Case Summary (Utah Division of Consumer Protection)</h2>

        <p class="meta">
          Subject: Doofus Squint; , LLC (dba Wiring harness Retardation); Harry Potter Esquire, LLC.<br>
          DCP Legal File No. CP-2017-093.
        </p>

        <p>
          In a consumer transaction involving a wiring-harness restoration, the Utah Division of Consumer Protection alleged that the
          respondents misrepresented pricing and completion time, failed to deliver the service within the timeframe represented,
          and did not provide a timely refund/return option after delays.
        </p>

        <p>
          The citation further alleged attempts to impose unauthorized charges (including additional “administrative” and storage fees),
          hostile/threatening communications, a small-claims lawsuit seeking amounts not agreed to, and impersonation of a State of Utah
          investigator in connection with service of legal documents.
        </p>

        <p>
          The matter was later resolved by a settlement agreement requiring return of the property, dismissal of the lawsuit, cessation of
          contact with the consumer, cease-and-desist terms, and payment of fines (with a portion suspended contingent on compliance).

  <h2>Case Summary (Public Records Snapshot)</h2>

  <p class="meta">
    Subject: Doofus Squint (operator); a wiring-harness shop (name omitted); related entities (names omitted).<br>
    Jurisdiction referenced in filings: a Utah municipal justice court and a Utah consumer-protection agency.

    Allegations summarized from court filings. Not findings of fact. Not verified by this site.

  <p>
    The public documents linked below include a “return of service” form filed with a Utah court and a written message
    sent to the court by the opposing party. These materials are presented for commentary and criticism and have been
    anonymized to avoid publishing personal information.
  </p>

  <p>
    In the court filing, the process server states that legal papers were delivered at an alternate address after the
    recipient did not accept service directly. The form reflects that the court received the filing in early 2018.
  </p>

  <p>
    In the court message, the writer asks for more time to respond and describes a dispute over a wiring-harness job,
    including price paid, delays, and return/refund concerns. The message also alleges hostile communications and
    retaliation connected to the dispute. These are the writer’s statements within the filing.

            <h3>Public Reply Analysis</h3>
            <p>
              This response is unprofessional, defensive, and self-sabotaging. Instead of addressing the complaint,
              you attack the customer, make unprovable accusations, rant about the BBB, and air legal threats in public.
              You also contradict yourself by claiming a “lifetime warranty” while boasting about “zero warranty claims,”
              which raises serious questions about whether customers can actually use your warranty at all. It reads like
              a personal meltdown, not a business reply. Even if the customer is wrong, your response makes you look volatile,
              unaccountable, and risky to deal with. You did more damage to your reputation than the original review ever could.

            <h3>Public Reply Analysis</h3>
            <p>
              This response is rambling, incoherent, and reads like a courtroom rant, not a professional business reply.
              You blame the customer, hide behind “production lines” and contracts, and repeatedly accuse them of dishonesty
              instead of clearly addressing the hostage, delay, and money concerns. Telling the public to “avoid this customer”
              is petty and alarming. The lack of clarity, the hostile tone, and the constant contract-shielding only reinforce
              the perception that customers lose control of their property once you have it. This response does more to
              validate the complaint than to refute it.

            <h3>Public Reply Analysis</h3>
            <p>
              This response is unhinged, arrogant, and catastrophically self-destructive. You open by lecturing about
              “faith in humanity,” then immediately accuse the customer of dishonesty, defamation, blackmail, and harming
              his own client — all without proof. That is not a defense, it’s a tantrum. You again hide behind contracts,
              “production lines,” and military discounts while completely ignoring the core accusation: the customer paid,
              waited a year, and still doesn’t have his property. Repeating “we won’t be bullied” and “avoid this customer”
              only reinforces the impression that once you have someone’s harness, they are at your mercy. Claiming a
              “lifetime warranty” while bragging about “zero warranty claims” just confirms what readers already suspect:
              your warranty is functionally unusable. This reply doesn’t protect your reputation — it obliterates it.
              If this is how you speak in public, no rational customer will trust you in private.
